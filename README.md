# The-AI-Doctor-Heart-Disease-Diagnostics-
The Goal: Heart disease is a big problem around the world. Doctors have to look at many test results to find it. I wanted to build an AI tool that can look at health signs—like cholesterol and chest pain—to predict if a patient has heart disease.

What I Did? I used a famous medical dataset to train my model.

Data Cleaning: Computers can't read text, so I changed categories (like "Chest Pain Type") into numbers. This is called "One-Hot Encoding."

Exploring: I made charts to see which patients were at high risk. I found that the "Thallium Stress Test" result was very important for finding the disease.

The Model: I used a Random Forest Classifier. Medical data is complicated, and this model is very good at finding patterns between age, heart rate, and blood pressure.

What I Learned I learned that mistakes in healthcare are dangerous. If the AI says a sick person is "Healthy," that is very bad. I learned that for medical projects, it is better to be safe and catch every case (High Recall) than just to have a high accuracy score.
